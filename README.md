# Single-cell analysis of peripheral blood cells and kidney cells derived from patients with systemic sclerosis or healthy donors. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of kidney cells derived from patients with scleroderma renal crisis or healthy donors.

## Overview
This repository provides codes used for CITE-seq analyses of >230,000 WBCs from 21 patients with systemic sclerosis and 6 healthy donors, as well as codes used for Abseq analyses of >15000 peripheral blood or kidney cells from a patient at the onset of scleroderma renal crisis. This repository also provides codes used for CosMX spatial transcriptomic analysis of kidney tissue cells from three patients with scleroderma renal crisis and three healthy donors.
